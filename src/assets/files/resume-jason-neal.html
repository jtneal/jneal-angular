        <h1>Final <em>Words</em></h1>
        <p>I first began developing websites in the mid-to-late 90's using popular tools of the time such as Expage,
          Angelfire, and Geocities. Oh, how times have changed, but even after all these years, I still maintain now
          the same passion for building websites that I had back then.</p>
        <p>In fact, everyone that knows me well will tell you just that - I am very passionate about my work. I love
          developing websites and web applications, I love learning, improving, building, and tinkering, and I
          couldn't imagine having a more fitting career. Even after finishing up a full day at work, I often find
          myself at home working on my own personal projects late into the night. My goal is to find a company
          with employees that share this passion, where we can grow together and help cultivate success.</p>
